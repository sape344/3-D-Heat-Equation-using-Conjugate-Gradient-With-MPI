In Numerical Algorithms, every matrix represents a real-world problem, because matrices are the most efficient tool in order to converting from physical problems to computer language. 3D Heat Map is an example of them. 3D Heat Map can be used to simulate heat flowing in order to obtain potentially dangerous situations and improvements on a material. Without a doubt, 3D Heat Map be beneficial to solve a lot of different problems. In addition to that, Matrix Equation cannot be answered without a Matrix equation solver method. For my project, my solver method is Conjugate Gradient. The reason which is behind the selected Conjugate Gradient method is that Conjugate Gradient be used in different fields, like AI.

Apart from these, I used the Finite Difference Method to obtain the A matrix. So, I can explain the algorithm I use
